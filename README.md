## 🚀 Web Version Deploy

1. You can quickly deploy the web version of Cerebr to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyym68686%2Fcerebr)

2. You can deploy to Cloudflare Pages:

2.1 After registering a Cloudflare account, apply for a Workers API TOKEN. 

After entering the Cloudflare homepage, select "Profile" in the upper right corner -> "My Profile" -> "API Tokens" -> "Create Token" -> "Edit Cloudflare Workers" -> You can choose the permissions for "Account Resources" and "Zone Resources" by yourself -> Continue to summary -> Create Token -> Save the token (**Note:** Save your token properly as it will only be displayed once). 

2.2 Return to the homepage, find "Workers" on the left -> Open "Workers & Pages" -> Click "Create" -> "Pages" -> "Import an existing Git repository" -> Find the forked repository -> Begin setup. 

2.3 Enter a name you like for the project, and in the "Build command" field, input:

`npm install -g wrangler && wrangler pages deploy . --project-name cerebr --branch main` 

2.4 In the "Environment variables (advanced)" section below -> Add variable: 

`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Fill in the API just applied for 
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Obtained from the URL of the Cloudflare dashboard homepage, in the format like https://dash.cloudflare.com/<ACCOUNT_ID> 

2.5 Save and deploy. 

(Since direct build and deployment will cause the API and accountID to be saved in plain text, if you want to change them to ciphertext, you can choose to click "Continue to project" after deployment is completed -> "Settings" -> "Variables and Secrets" -> "Edit" -> Change the "Text" form to "Secret" -> Save)

3. You can also deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
# Fork this repository
# Then go to your repository's Settings -> Pages
# In the "Build and deployment" section:
# - Select "Deploy from a branch" as Source
# - Choose your branch (main/master) and root (/) folder
# - Click Save
```

The deployment will be automatically handled by GitHub Actions. You can access your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/cerebr`
